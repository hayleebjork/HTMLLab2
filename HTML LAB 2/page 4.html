<h1 style="color:gold; font-size: 40px">English 304</h1>
<p class = "p2">This semester I'm taking English 304, my professor for this class is Eric Wolfe. It is a class about early American Literature. So far we have read stories from the reconstruction era after the Civil War. I've really enjoyed the readings from this class!</p>
<p class = "p2">We read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. I already read the book in highschool and honestly it's not my favorite. Other than that assignment I've liked reading the other stories we'ved talked about in class.</p>
