<h1 style="color:blue; font-size: 40px">About me</h1>
<p class ="p2">My main hobby I like to do is taking pictures! In Valley City there wasn't that much to do there because it's a really small town. Taking pictures of my friends is one the most fun and easy things to do! I hope one day I could do that as a part of my career as well. <p>
